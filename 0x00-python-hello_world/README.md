10. Technical interview preparation:

       This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solution’s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.
       
       Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.
               Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t *list);
       Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle
       
                        Requirements:                
       Only these functions are allowed: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, free

11. Write a Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line

12. Write a script that compiles a Python script file.

        The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable $PYFILE

        The output filename has to be $PYFILEc (ex: export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc)

14. Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:

          3           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (98)
                      3 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
                      6 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
                      9 BINARY_POWER
                      10 BINARY_ADD
                      11 RETURN_VALUE
